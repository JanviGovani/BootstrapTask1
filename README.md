# Bootstrap5 UI — Internship Task


Quick starter project that fulfills the internship task requirements: 3 pages, Bootstrap 5 via CDN, responsive components (Navbar, Hero/Carousel, Cards, Forms).


## Files included
- `index.html` — Home page (Navbar, Hero carousel, Features, Testimonials, Footer)
- `about.html` — About / Services page with cards
- `contact.html` — Contact page with a working form (replace action with Formspree or your backend)
- `assets/css/styles.css` — Small custom styles


## How to use (fast)
1. Clone the repo locally.
2. Replace the Formspree action in `contact.html` or wire to your backend.
3. Test locally: `open index.html` in the browser (or use `Live Server` extension).


## Deploy to GitHub Pages (quick)
1. Create a new GitHub repo and push the files.
2. Go to repo Settings → Pages → Set branch to `main` (or `gh-pages`) and root `/`.
3. Wait a minute — your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.
